![Photon Firmware](photon-firmware.png)

Photon is Open-Source firmware for pick and place feeders.

A feeder is a small machine that moves component tape very small, precise increments in order to automatically serve up new components to a pick and place machine.

Photon was originally developed as part of the LumenPnP project, but it is designed to support many types of hardware.
